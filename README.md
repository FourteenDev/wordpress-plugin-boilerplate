1. Search for `WordPressBoilerplatePlugin` to capture the namespaces.
2. Search for `FDWPBP` to capture the constants.
3. Search for `fdwpbp` to capture option name and slugs.
4. Search for `wordpress-boilerplate-plugin` to capture the text domains.

Then, update the header in `plugin.php` with your own information.
